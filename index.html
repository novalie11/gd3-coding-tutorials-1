            When Rania Matar started to photograph Clara, independently assumed
            the pose of an odalisque—a recumbent female figure used in Western
            art as an emblem of exoticism and female sensuality. This photograph
            is part of Matar’s series <em>L’Enfant-Femme</em> (2011–16). That
            French expression describes the fleeting preteen and early teen
            stage when a girl starts to become a woman.

            For over a decade, Tauba Auerbach has explored systems of

            <em>Plate Distortion III</em> belongs to a series that she created
            by folding and bending a thin sheet of copper foil covered in grainy
            aquatint. The material was then affixed to a sturdier plate and
            printed, so that the effects of Auerbach’s manipulation became the
            image itself, referencing the history and experimental potential of
            printmaking materials and tools.

            translates it to the monochromatic palette of etching. Working with
            contemporary publisher Two Palms, Schutz created dense, painterly
            layers of grainy aquatint. Although the ten images suggest a vague
            story line, the artist left their meaning to the viewer to
            interpret.

            This print by Nicole Eisenman references the German Expressionist
            artist Erich Heckel’s 1919 woodcut <em>Portrait of a Man</em>.
            Eisenman reversed the direction of the original image but adapted
            the sideways glance and clasped hands seen in the elder artist’s
            print. In the upper right corner, she added a small moon, and
            printed the two sides of the image in black and white, suggesting
            that the figure is outside looking in.

            Brooklyn-based painter Dana Schutz is known for largescale
            figurative painting, often drawing on narrative and humor. This
            print portfolio evokes Schutz’s signature subject matter, but
            translates it to the monochromatic palette of etching. Working with
            contemporary publisher, Two Palms, Schutz created dense, painterly
            layers of grainy aquatint. Although the ten images suggest a vague
            storyline, the artist left their meaning to the viewer to interpret.

            He writes: “My portrayal of my children now borders on appropriation

            To create her life-size horses, American sculptor Deborah
            Butterfield casts found pieces of wood into bronze, a process that
            translates the wood’s porous texture into metal. The artist then
            builds the structure of her sculptures, using her extensive
            knowledge of the animals to achieve their lifelike postures.
            Butterfield accomplishes this effect through the placement of the
            necks and heads of her horses, which she does last. In
            <em>Horse,</em> the abstract animal is integrated with the
            surrounding landscape to evoke the artist’s expansive Montana ranch
            where she has lived, worked, and kept horses for over 30 years.

            Weavers created them for the elites of the Imerina Kingdom (c.
            1540–1897), whose royals gave them as diplomatic gifts. In the
            1990s, Lamba SARL Studio revived this weaving practice. Its artists
            create innovative display textiles drawn from extensive studies of

            woven by adding extra weft (horizontal) threads. Its title

            metal objects that often have ties with the industrial history of a
            place. These “drain drawings” relate to her broader interest in the
            ways that urban architecture and artifacts link residents and

            In this rubbing, she captured one of many sewer drain covers found

            <em>Bare Arms (The Practice #1)</em>, one of a pair of drypoints by
            Darius Steward in the CMA’s collection, forms part of the artist’s
            ongoing exploration of his childhood in East Cleveland in
            juxtaposition to that of his own children, whom the work represents.
            He writes: “My portrayal of my children now borders on appropriation
            of many personal moments and memories. I recognize what they are
            experiencing and make connections between what I experienced some 30
            years ago versus what I missed out on in East Cleveland. I have
            greater aspirations for a better life for my children and all
            people.” In <em>Bare Arms (The Practice</em> <em>#1)</em> Steward’s
            skilled draftsmanship and unusual, cropped composition conveys
            physical struggle in the guise of play.

            To create <em>El Manto Negro</em>, Margolles collaborated with
            artisans in Mata Ortiz, Mexico, a region known for its ceramic work.
            The artisans produced thousands of square-shaped ceramic tiles,
            sourced from deposits at the base of Mata Ortiz’s mountainous zone.
            Each tile represents a victim of the drug wars that are now rampant
            in the region; as a grid, they speak to a collective history.
            <em>El Manto Negro</em> presents Mata Ortiz not only as a site that
            has fallen prey to violence, but also as a site of artistic
            productivity that prevails alongside hardship.

            to combine modern dance and African American culture. The subject
            appears with a casual pose and assertive gaze that align with the
            artist’s goal, in her words, to “paint black people just being

            The landscape, a primary subject in Chinese painting, here features
            a female figure in nature, traditionally reserved to the male
            figure, while women usually occupy the domestic interior. The artist
            also breaches conventions by juxtaposing the landscape with an
            affectionate letter from European composer, Gustav Mahler, to his
            wife Alma, presented in her own calligraphy.

            Contemporary Brooklyn-based artist Nicola López explores the concept
            of place in her work, inspired by a longstanding interest in
            anthropology. This print belongs to López’s
            <em>Monuments</em> series, in which she created abstract images
            based on the urban landscape. Objects from everyday life—here, a
            satellite dish—are presented in forms and settings that
            monumentalize them beyond their regular use.

            This portrait, made using a flatbed scanner as the camera, engages
            in a dialogue between contemporary technology and the early days of

            harken back to the limitations of the first photographic processes.
            Unlike the small-scale of historic images, Bross prints her image
            larger than life-size, enhancing the tension between the
            photograph’s intimacy and its simultaneous sense of distance.

            <em>Las Meninas</em> draws on traditions throughout global art and
            culture to address issues surrounding the female body, race, beauty,
            and community. The work’s skirted form conjures figures from the
            Spanish Golden Age painting <em>Las Meninas</em> (1656) by Diego
            Velazquez, apparel worn in the Afro-Brazilian religious tradition
            candomblé, and Mousgoum buildings in Cameroon. The white-glazed
            terracotta torso, alluding to sacred and secular traditions of body
            painting, leads to a faceless head, incorporating both figuration
            and abstraction.

            Polly Apfelbaum’s work builds upon the American abstract tradition
            of color field, pop, and abstract expressionist painting, while
            rejecting what she calls the “aggressive masculinity” of these
            movements. <em>Atomic Mystic Cosmic 16 </em>was stimulated by a year
            Apfelbaum spent in Italy, when she became fascinated with drapery
            and colored fabrics depicted in Renaissance and Baroque paintings,
            as well as the decorative inlay of medieval mosaic floors. For the
            color, she employed the “rainbow roll” technique, in which multiple
            colors are partially mixed to achieve a continuous gradient effect.
            The effect is one of dazzling color and pattern, while also creating
            spatial relationships that complicate the composition’s hard-edged
            geometry.
